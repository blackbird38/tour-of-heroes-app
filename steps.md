Node.js
https://nodejs.org
#### ```node -v ```

npm package manager
https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install.html
#### ```npm -v```

cli- Command-line interface 
#### ```npm install -g @angular/cli```
(-g = globally)

#### ```ng new my-app```
#### ```cd my-app```
#### ```ng serve --open / ng serve -o```

application shell
```{{title}}``` the double curly braces are Angular's interpolation binding syntax
```src/styles.css``` - Put your application-wide styles here.

#### ng generate component heroes
The ```ngOnInit()``` is a lifecycle hook. Angular calls ```ngOnInit()``` shortly after creating a component. It's a good place to put initialization logic.


```<h2>{{hero.name | uppercase}} Details</h2>``` - The word uppercase in the interpolation binding, right after the pipe operator ( | ), activates the built-in UppercasePipe.

[Pipes](https://angular.io/guide/pipes) are a good way to format strings, currency amounts, dates and other display data. Angular ships with several built-in pipes and you can create your own.

```[(ngModel)]``` is Angular's two-way data binding syntax. ```ngModel``` is a valid Angular directive, but not available by default. It belongs to the optional ```FormsModule``` and you must opt-in to using it.
```<li *ngFor="let hero of heroes">``` The ```*ngFor``` is Angular's repeater directive. It repeats the host element for each element in a list. ```<li>``` is the host element.

You define private styles either inline in the ```@Component.styles``` array or as stylesheet file(s) identified in the ```@Component.styleUrls``` array.

```<li *ngFor="let hero of heroes" (click)="onSelect(hero)">``` This is an example of Angular's event binding syntax. The parentheses around ```click``` tell Angular to listen for the ```<li>``` element's click event. When the user clicks in the ```<li>```, Angular executes the ```onSelect(hero)``` expression.

Use Angular's ```*ngIf``` directive to conditionally include or exclude a block of HTML: ```<div *ngIf="selectedHero"></div>``` The component should only display the selected hero details if the selectedHero exists.

Toggle a CSS style class with a class binding: ```[class.selected]="hero === selectedHero"``` - when the current row hero is the same as the selectedHero, Angular adds the selected CSS class. When the two heroes are different, Angular removes the class.

### 3. Master/Detail Components
#### ```ng generate component hero-detail```

* created a separate, reusable HeroDetailComponent.
* used a property binding to give the parent HeroesComponent control over the child HeroDetailComponent.
* used the @Input decorator to make the hero property available for binding by the external HeroesComponent.

### 4. Services
Why? Components should focus on presenting data and delegate data access to a service. Services are a great way to share information among classes that don't know each other.

#### ```ng generate service hero```
To learn more about providers, see [Providers](https://angular.io/guide/providers). To learn more about injectors, see the [Dependency Injection guide](https://angular.io/guide/dependency-injection).

Observable is one of the key classes in the [RxJS library](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/).
Angular's HttpClient methods return RxJS Observables. [tuto](https://angular.io/tutorial/toh-pt6)

#### ```ng generate component messages```

#### ```ng generate service message```

Summary
* refactored data access to the HeroService class.
* registered the HeroService as the provider of its service at the root level so that it can be injected anywhere in the app.
* used Angular Dependency Injection to inject it into a component.
* gave the HeroService get data method an asynchronous signature.
* discovered Observable and the RxJS Observable library.
* used RxJS of() to return an observable of mock heroes (Observable<Hero[]>).
* The component's ngOnInit lifecycle hook calls the HeroService method, not the constructor.
* created a MessageService for loosely-coupled communication between classes.
* The HeroService injected into a component is created with another injected service, MessageService.

### 4. Routing
#### ```ng generate module app-routing --flat --module=app```
* --flat puts the file in src/app instead of its own folder.
* --module=app tells the CLI to register it in the imports array of the AppModule

#### ```ng generate component dashboard```
* added the Angular router to navigate among different components.
* turned the AppComponent into a navigation shell with <a> links and a <router-outlet>.
* configured the router in an AppRoutingModule
* defined simple routes, a redirect route, and a parameterized route.
* used the routerLink directive in anchor elements.
* refactored a tightly-coupled master/detail view into a routed detail view.
* used router link parameters to navigate to the detail view of a user-selected hero.
* shared the HeroService among multiple components.
