/*Notice that the new service imports the Angular Injectable symbol and annotates the class
with the @Injectable() decorator. This marks the class as one that participates in the dependency
 injection system. The HeroService class is going to provide an injectable service, and it can
  also have its own injected dependencies.
  The @Injectable() decorator accepts a metadata object for the service, the same way the
  @Component() decorator did for your component classes.

  The HeroService could get hero data from anywhereâ€”a web service, local storage,
